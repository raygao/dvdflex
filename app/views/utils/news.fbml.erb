  I got the idea for starting this project back in February. After coming back from
  Spain, I took several weeks to write this application.

  As of now, it does the following:
  1. Add a DVD listing using the UPC (bar) code. This is connect to Amazon lookup services,
  ISOHunter, and IMDB.
  2. Show that on your profile as well as add to your news feed.
  3. Search both Torrent and Amazon Video on Demand.
  4. Export your DVD listings in a CSV file for Excel.

  Upcoming features:
  1. Integration with NetFlix to pull-in your DVD Queues from there
  2. Open-Source the entire application.
