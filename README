== Welcome to DVD Flex ==

DVD is a Facebook Application. It is written using RubyonRails. It is dependent
on the followings:

Platform:
    Ruby 1.8.7
    Rails 2.2.2

Gems: (gem install *)
    MYSQL 2.7 drivers
    Mongrel
    Ruby-AAWS 0.7
    JSON
    IMDB 0.3
    HTTParty
    Facebooker
    Net-ssh
    Facebooker Authentication
    Tunnlr
    JRails
    Excel

Because I used NetBeans IDE as my development environment, you can easily open
up the project with that IDE. However, NetBeans has a bug in the debug mode. The
bug is related to OpenSSL and hashing. As a result, when you run the application
from within the NetBeans in the debug mode and try to add an item using UPC code,
Ruby-AAWS will complain.

The correct way to test the application is to run it in the command prompt with:
% script/server

Additionally, you will need to update following configuratiaon files:
1. facebooker.yml - Facebook Application Key and Application Secret.
2. Database.yml - Database connection setting for DVD Flex application.
3. Tunnlr.yml - If you wish to use Tunnlr service.
4. environment/development, production, and test - for Amazon Product Advertisting
API's associates and secret ID.
5. .amzonrc file in the root of the folder, used by the ruby-aaws, should match
development.rb, production.rb, or test.rb.

Additionally, if you wish to run the application in a cluster environment with
Mongrel/Pound configuration, the following setting can be used.

Pound.cfg:

ListenHTTP
	Address IP-address of the server
	Port	8888

	## allow PUT and DELETE also (by default only GET, POST and HEAD)?:
	xHTTP		0
